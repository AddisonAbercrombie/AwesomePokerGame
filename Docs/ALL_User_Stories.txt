Yeah! and I've set up and turned out this state
With my own two hands
We've traveled this land packed tight in minivans
And all this for the fans, girls, money, and fame
I play their game, and then they scream my name
I will show no shame, I live and die for this
If I come off soft, then chew on this
Are you scared?
Devil without cause, and I'm back
With the Beaver hat and Ben Davis slacks
30-pack of Stroh's, 30-pack of hoes
No rogaine in the propane flows
Chosen one, I'm the living proof
With the gift of gab from the city of truth
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back
And I did not stutter
When I said that I'm goin platinum, sellin rhymes
I went platinum, seven times
And still they ill they want to see us fry
I guess because of only God knows why why why why why
Oh, they call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say hey, hey
Let me hear where you're at and say hey, hey
I'm giving back so say hey, hey
Show me some metal and say hey, hey, hey, hey
I like AC/DC and ZZ Top
Bocephus, Beasties, and the Kings of Rock
Skynyrd, Seger, Limp, Korn, the Stones
David Allen Coe, and No Show Jones
Yeah! Pass that bottle around
Got the rock from Detroit and soul from Motown
The underground stoned fuckin pimp
With tracks that mack and slap back the whack
Never get in the way, I don't play with with that
But watch me rock with Liberace flash
Punk rock the Clash, Boy Bands are trash
I like Johnny Cash and Grandmaster Flash
Oh, they call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say hey, hey
Let me hear where you're at and say hey, hey
I'm giving back so say hey, hey
Show me some metal and say hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, I saw your band
Jumping around on stage like a bunch of wounded ducks
When you gunna learn sucker?
You just can't fuck with Twisted Brown
Trucker
I'm an American Bad Ass
Watch me kick, you can roll with Rock
Or you can suck my dick
I'm a porno flick, I'm like Amazing Grace
I'm gunna fuck some hoes after I rock this place
Superfly living doublewide
Side car on my Glide so Joe see can ride
Full sack to share, bringin' flash and flair
Got the long hair swinging, middle finger in the air
Snake skin suits, 65 Chevelle
See me ride in sin hear the rebel yell
I won't live to tell, so if you do
Give the next generation a big 'fuck you'
Who knew I'd blow up like Oklahoma
Said fuck high school, pissed on my diploma
Smell the aroma, check my hits
I know it stinks in here, cause I'm the Shit
Oh, they call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say hey, hey
Let me hear where you're at and say hey, hey
I'm giving back so say hey, hey
Show me some metal and say hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm a cowboy, bad ass in black singing hey, hey, hey, hey
From side to side from front to back say hey, hey, hey, hey
I put Detroit City back on the map by singin hey, hey, hey, hey
Kid Rocks in the house and that's where I'm at!
